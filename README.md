### Overview

Subprober  is a powerful and efficient tool designed for penetration testers and security professionals. This release introduces several enhancements, bug fixes, and new features to elevate your subdomain probing experience. Subprober facilitates fast and reliable information extraction, making it an invaluable asset for penetration testing workflows.

### Features in V1.0.7:
- Subprober is capable to handle high loads
- accuracy and concurrency are improved
- add extra configuration in probing saving outputs
- added new command `-dhp` `--disable-http-probe` to only probe https protocol
- improved subprober's memory allocations
- added deduplication that remove duplicated urls and etc..

### Installation and Updates

##### Method 1:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/sanjai-AK47/Subprober.git
subprober -h
```

#### Method 2:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanjai-AK47/SubProber.git
cd Subprober
pip install .
subprober -h
```



### Recommended Concurrencies:

**Info:** Subprober is improved with higher concurrency and accuracy for probings and recommend the users to use the concurrencies less which is efficient and accurate for probing
  - 30-50   : this range of concurrency can be given when probing for more than 50K+ Subdomains, ips, domains etc..
  - 50-80   : this range of concurrency can be given when probing for more than 100K+ Subdomains, ips, domains etc..
  - 100-120 : this range of concurrency can be given when probing for more than 150K+ Subdomains, ips, domains etc..

Note higher concurrency values may results in inaccurate results because subprober builded with higher concurrency and more accurate than other probing tool with following mentioned concurrency values

### Usage

```yaml
subprober -h

Subprober - An essential HTTP multi-purpose Probing Tool for Penetration testers

[Description] :

    Subprober is a high-performance tool designed for probing and  extract vital information efficiently.

[Options]:


    [INPUT]:

        -f,   --filename              Specify the filename containing a list of subdomains for targeted probing. 
                                      This flag is used to find and analyze status codes and other pertinent details.
                                      
        -u,   --url                   Specify a target URL for direct probing. This flag allows for the extraction of 
                                      status codes and other valuable information.
                                      
        stdin                         Subprober supports stdin input by using cat or echo command with subprober using pipe `|`
                                      
    [PROBES-CONFIG]:


        -tl,  --title                 Retrieve and display the title of subdomains.
 
        -sv,  --server                Identify and display the server information associated with subdomains.

        -wc,  --word-count            Retrieve and display the content length of subdomains.
        
        -l ,  --location              Display the redirected location of the response.

        -apt, --application-type      Determine and display the application type of subdomains.

        -p,   --path                  Specify a path for probe and get results ex:: -p admin.php
    
        -px,  --proxy                 Specify a proxy to send the requests through your proxy or BurpSuite ex: 127.0.0.1:8080
    
        -gw,  --grep-word             Enable The grep word flag will be usefull when grepping partiuclar codes like for 200: OK ---> cat subprober-results.txt | grep OK 
                                      This will show the results with 200-299 range codes
                                                                  
        -ar,  --allow-redirect        Enabling these flag will make Subprober to follow the redirection and ger results

        -mc,  --match                 Specify specific response status code(s) to include in the analysis.
                                      
    [OUTPUT]:
    
        -o,   --output                Define the output filename to store the results of the probing operation.
